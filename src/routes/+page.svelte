      recipe: `Serves six (but you will have leftovers) and takes about two hours to make. Prepare the rice the day before.
Ingredients:

2 cups of nice long grain or jasmine or basmati rice
1 pound ham slice, cubed (size of a sugar cube)
1 pound of andouille sausage, coin sliced
1 pound of chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces, par boiling makes it easier to cut
Optional: 1 pound of small peeled raw shrimp, sprinkled with Creole seasoning
5 large onions, diced
1 - 2 bell peppers, diced
1 bunch of celery, diced
1 bunch of green onions, thinly sliced
1 entire pod of garlic, minced
1 tablespoon of Creole seasoning
1 tablespoon of dried thyme
1 tablespoon of dried basil
1 tablespoon of salt
2 teaspoons of black pepper
hot sauce to taste
1 8 oz can of tomato sauce for color. You won't use all of it or maybe you will.
1/2 cup of chopped parsely for garnish

1. Cook the rice the day before. Under cook just a little. Rinse rice with cold water in a colander to stop cooking. Put colander on a plate and in refrigerator uncovered. The reason is you want all the juices and seasonings to be absorbed when you assemble the jambalaya. Take the colander out when you start making the jambalaya to let it get to room temperature.
2 - 3. You are going to do two things in parallel: 2 a - c and 3 a - c.
2a. Brown Andouille sausage and put aside. Save the grease.
2b. Brown diced ham in the Andouille grease and put aside.
2c. Do the same with the chicken pieces and put aside.
3a. On medium to low heat, sauté bell pepper and celery until they start getting soft
3b. Add the onions and sauté onions until transparent
3c. Add the green onions and garlic and sauté for a few minutes
4. Add all the meat from 2a - 2c the seasonings and tomato sauce. Combine.
5. Gently add the rice and fold the meat mixture into the rice. You want to warm the rice. Don't stir too much as you don't want the rice to get mushy.
6. Optional: Add shrimp once the rice is heated, cover the pot and cook for 4-5 minutes depending on their size or until pink. You don't want to overcook and have rubbery shrimp.
7. Serve in large shallow bowls and garnish with parsely.`
