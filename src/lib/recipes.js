      recipe: `Serves six (but you will have leftovers) and takes about two hours to make. Prepare the rice the day before.

Ingredients:

2 cups of nice long grain or jasmine or basmati rice
1 pound ham slice, cubed (size of a sugar cube)
1 pound of andouille sausage, coin sliced
1 pound of chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces, par boiling makes it easier to cut
Optional: 1 pound of small peeled raw shrimp, sprinkled with Creole seasoning
5 large onions, diced
1 - 2 bell peppers, diced
1 bunch of celery, diced
1 bunch of green onions, thinly sliced
1 entire pod of garlic, minced
1 tablespoon of Creole seasoning
1 tablespoon of dried thyme
1 tablespoon of dried basil
1 tablespoon of salt
2 teaspoons of black pepper
hot sauce to taste
1 8 oz can of tomato sauce for color. You won't use all of it or maybe you will.
1/2 cup of chopped parsely for garnish

Cooking instructions:

1. Cook the rice the day before. Under cook just a little. Rinse rice with cold water in a colander to stop cooking. Put colander on a plate and in refrigerator uncovered. The reason is you want all the juices and seasonings to be absorbed when you assemble the jambalaya. Take the colander out when you start making the jambalaya to let it get to room temperature.
2 - 3. You are going to do two things in parallel: 2 a - c and 3 a - c.
2a. Brown Andouille sausage and put aside. Save the grease.
2b. Brown diced ham in the Andouille grease and put aside.
2c. Do the same with the chicken pieces and put aside.
3a. On medium to low heat, sauté bell pepper and celery until they start getting soft
3b. Add the onions and sauté onions until transparent
3c. Add the green onions and garlic and sauté for a few minutes
4. Add all the meat from 2a - 2c the seasonings and tomato sauce. Combine.
5. Gently add the rice and fold the meat mixture into the rice. You want to warm the rice. Don't stir too much as you don't want the rice to get mushy.
6. Optional: Add shrimp once the rice is heated, cover the pot and cook for 4-5 minutes depending on their size or until pink. You don't want to overcook and have rubbery shrimp.
7. Serve in large shallow bowls and garnish with parsely.`

2 pounds fresh, peeled Louisiana crawfish tails with fat (the orange stuff)

8. Discard the bay leaf and serve the crawfish etouffee with steamed rice.

Crawfish Stock 
20 minutes to prep and about four hours of cooking time. Yeah, this takes a long time but it is so worth it!

Ingredients:

16 to 20 cups cold water
4 to 6 quarts crawfish shells and claws
¼ cup melted butter
1 large onion quartered
1 large bell pepper quartered
5 or 6 stalks celery with leaves
2 heads garlic sliced in half
1 bunch parsley tied together
30 peppercorns in a spice bag

Herb and Spice Blend-Tied in a Bouguet Garni
1 ounce fresh thyme
1 ounce fresh basil
1 ounce fresh oregano

Cooking Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Place the butter in a pyrex measuring cup and melt in microwave.
3. Spread crawfish shells and claws in a single layer on a lined baking sheet. (Use two baking sheets if necessary).
4. Pour melted butter over the shells and claws and mix together so some butter gets on all the shells.
5. Place baking sheets in preheated oven and let roast for about 20 minutes.
6. Quarter the onion and bell pepper-no need to peel or de-seed. 
7. Chop the celery into halves. 
8. Tie the herbs together in a Bouquet Garni and tie the bunch of parsley together. 
9. Place peppercorns in a small spice bag.
10. Now you are ready to make the stock.


Make the Stock:

1. Remove the shells from the oven and add them and the resulting juice into a large stock pot. (If using two baking dishes, place shells from one in the stock pot, then add vegetables before adding remaining shells)
2. Add all the cut vegetables, parsley, garlic, Bouquet Garni and pepper to the stock pot and mix together with shells.
3. Add the cold water, making sure to cover the shells by about 2 inches.
4. Place the stock pot over high heat and bring to a heavy boil.
5. Reduce heat to a high simmer, cover the pot and simmer for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally to keep things mixed up.
6. Remove the cover and maintain a high simmer for 2 to 2 ½ hours until the liquid has reduced down to about half of the original volume.
7. Turn off the heat and allow to cool so it will be easier to handle and the flavors continue to blend. 
8. Place a strainer or colander over a large bowl. Using a slotted spoon, place the solids into the strainer and allow to drain.
9. Continue this until all the solids have been removed from the stock pot.
10. Discard all the solids and return the drained stock back into the stockpot.
11. Place some cheese cloth in the strainer or colander, or use a very fine mesh strainer, and pour the liquid through to remove any remaining solids.
12. This can be used immediately or stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
13. If the stock will not be used within a couple of days, place the strained stock in freezer containers, label and freeze for put to six months.

Recipe Notes
Roasting the shells prior to making the stock intensifies the flavor.
Use fresh herbs if you can. If you tie them together using butcher twine it will be easier to pull them out when you're done.  If you are using dry herbs, place those, along with the peppercorns in a cheese cloth bag. Bundling your herbs and spices like this is called Bouguet Garni
I never add salt when making stock. In this case, the crawfish shells may have some remaining salt from the boiling spices. You'll want to salt the final dish you are making with the stock, so you don't want the stock too salty.
You can make a seafood stock with this recipe by using crab shells instead of crawfish shells, just a different flavor profile.
